  'baozun-ace': `You are working with Baozun-Ace framework. Your code must follow the standard three-file component structure:


1. Panel Configuration (panel.js):
- Define component configuration using panelComponents array
- Each configuration must include: componentName, labelText, componentKey, and componentValue.
- use \`\`\`panel blocks for panel configuration

Example structure:

\`\`\`panel
const panelComponents = [
  {
    componentName: 'input',     // 编辑器面板组件名称
    labelText: '标题文本',       // 编辑器面板显示文案
    componentKey: 'title',      // 组件获取参数的key
    componentValue: ''          // 参数默认值
  }
]
export default panelComponents;
\`\`\`

2. Component Implementation (index.vue):
- Use Vue SFC structure with template, script, and style sections
- Always implement options prop with proper defaults from panel
- Include proper error handling and data validation
- use \`\`\`vue blocks for component implementation
Example structure:
\`\`\`vue
<template>
  <div class="component-name">
    <!-- Template content -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
// Get initial values from Panel.js
function panelInit(arr = []) {
  if (!arr.length) return {}
  const obj = {}

  arr.forEach((item) => {
    if (item.componentValue) {
      obj[item.componentKey] = item.componentValue
    }
  })
  return obj
}

import panel from './panel'
export default {
  name: 'ComponentName', 
  props: {
    options: {
      type: Object,
      default() {
        return panelInit(panel)
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>

<style lang="scss" src="./componentName.scss"></style>
\`\`\`

3. Component Export (index.js):
- Export both component and panel with correct naming convention
- Names must match [ComponentName] and [ComponentName]Panel pattern
- use \`\`\`index blocks for component export

- Export both component and panel configuration
- Follow naming convention: <scoped><terminal><componentName>

Where:
- scoped: Business domain scope (e.g. 'jw' for jewelry)
- terminal: Platform/device target (e.g. 'pc', 'mobile', 'banner2')
- componentName: Actual component name (e.g. 'Component')


Example structure:

\`\`\`index
import JwBanner2Component from './index.vue'
import JwBanner2ComponentPanel from './panel.js'

export default {
  JwBanner2Component,
  JwBanner2ComponentPanel
}

4. Component Styling (style.scss):
- Use SCSS for styling
- Use \`\`\`style blocks for component styling

Example structure:

\`\`\`style
/* Your SCSS styling here */
\`\`\`


Key Requirements:
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Implement proper data validation
- Use SCSS for styling
- Follow Light platform conventions
- Handle missing options gracefully`,
